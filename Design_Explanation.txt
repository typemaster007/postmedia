Python - Word Occurence Counter of Input File
---------------------------------------------
This is a simple python based application that takes a UTF-8 text file as input and gives the total number of words in the file and the top 10 most common words with their occurence count.


--------------------------
Assumptions/Constraints
--------------------------
1. Do not use Collections.Counter class
2. Implement the input file as part of command line arguments to python execution
3. PEP-8 level code organization best practices
4. Implement a test suite with tests.py file

--------------------------
Solution:
--------------------------
The program accepts an input file (UTF - 8) as an argument in the command line execution statement as follows:

python <app.py> <input_data_file>

The program first checks for the "file present" condition with try catch blocks. The input file is then opened and checked for "empty file" condition and whitespaces.
The separator for identifying words is a whitespace. The separated words are then sent through a cleaning function that removes wild characters and special characters. 
Only alphanumeric values are returned back for the next stage.

A Dictionary variable is used to store each word and its occurence count as it offers a key-value based structure that we need for this activity.
The dictionary is sorted using the sort built in method. This was chosen rather than implementing a quick or merge sort logic as the compiler 
optimizes the best sorting algorithm. 

The sort method takes a key for sorting which in this case is the number of occurences of each word. The python lambda 
function offers an anonymous function with default input. For the dictionary d, the values field is d[1] and the key is d[0]. 
The sorting function uses the values field and the keyword "reverse = True" and sorts the dictionary in the descending order.

The final result is then returned back to the calling function.

Testing
---------------------
The test suite can be executed by running "python tests.py"

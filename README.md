Author : Amogh Adithya Bangalore

What Is This?
-------------
This is a simple python based application that takes a UTF-8 text file as input and gives the total number
of words in the file and the top 10 most common words with their occurence count.



How To Use This
---------------

1. Extract the compressed folder into a directory of your choice.
2. Change directory to the postmedia folder and open the command prompt.
3. Run the application by using "python .\app.py .\input.txt"  where app.py is the main application file and input.txt is the input word count file
4. Optionally you can change the input.txt file to check the result for your own custom input data.
5. To run the test cases, you can use the 'tests'.py by running "python tests.py"
